## 题目：692. Top K Frequent Words

https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/

Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

```

Example 1:

Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
```

## 思路：

类似973 


## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        ##用最大堆保证 lexicographical order.#O(nlogn)
        counter = collections.Counter(words)

        heap = []
        for key, value in counter.items():
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-value, key)) #O(logn)

        res =[]
        i = 0
        while len(heap) > 0 and i < k:
            value, key = heappop(heap)
            res.append(key)
            i += 1

        return res
```
**不对**
```python
        ##用最小堆不能保证 lexicographical order.#O(nlogk)
        counter = collections.Counter(words) ##就比973多了这些，其实思路一样

        heap = []
        for key, value in counter.items():
            heapq.heappush(heap, (value, key)) #O(logk)
            if len(heap) > k: 
                heapq.heappop(heap)

        res =[]
        while len(heap) > 0:
            value, key = heappop(heap)
            res.append(key)

        return res[::-1]
  
```
