## 题目：
```
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
t.length == s.length
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.

    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        
        hashs = dict() #key s[i]: value:t[i]
        hasht = dict() #key t[i]: value:s[i]
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if (s[i] in hashs and hashs[s[i]]!=t[i]) or (t[i] in hasht and hasht[t[i]]!=s[i]): #collison
                return False
            hashs[s[i]] = t[i] 
            hasht[t[i]] = s[i]
        return True
```
