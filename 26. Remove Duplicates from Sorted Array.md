## 题目：
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```
Example 2:
```

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 
```
Constraints:
```
0 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
```

## 思路：
**哈希表一种方法**
**快慢双指针**
![a](https://github.com/SSRRBB/Leetcode/blob/main/Images/143.png)



## 答案：
**哈希表**
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        #哈希表
        res = 0
        hashset = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num not in hashset:
                nums[res] = num
                res += 1
                hashset.add(num)
        
        return res
    


```


**快慢同向双指针**
```python
       #双指针
        
        n = len(nums)
        slow = 0
        for fast in range(n):
            if nums[fast] != nums[slow]:
                slow += 1
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
        return slow + 1


```
