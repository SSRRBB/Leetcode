## 题目：139. Word Break

https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/

Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 300
1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
All the strings of wordDict are unique.
```

## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        #Time complexity : O(n^3)There are two nested loops, and substring computation at each iteration. Overall that results in O(n^3)O
        #Space complexity : O(n)O(n). Length of pp array is n+1n+1.
        #dp[i] 表示 s 的前 i 位是否可以用 wordDictwordDict 中的单词表示
        n=len(s)
        dp=[False]*(n+1)
        dp[0]=True
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n+1):
                if dp[i] and s[i:j] in wordDict:
                    dp[j]=True 
        return dp[-1]
```
