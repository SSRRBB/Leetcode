https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance/

Given an array of strings wordsDict and two different strings that already exist in the array word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: wordsDict = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"], word1 = "coding", word2 = "practice"
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: wordsDict = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"], word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= wordsDict.length <= 3 * 104
1 <= wordsDict[i].length <= 10
wordsDict[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
word1 and word2 are in wordsDict.
word1 != word2
```

## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, wordsDict: List[str], word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        ## 时间O(n)
        res = len(wordsDict)
        p1 = -1
        p2 = -1
        for i in range(len(wordsDict)):
            if wordsDict[i] == word1: 
                p1 = i
            elif wordsDict[i] == word2:
                p2 = i
                
            if p1 != -1 and p2!= -1:
                res = min(res, abs(p1 - p2))
        return res

        # Brute force O(n^2)
        res = len(wordsDict)
        for i, word in enumerate(wordsDict):
            if word == word1:
                for j, words in enumerate(wordsDict):
                    if words == word2:
                        res = min(res, abs(i - j))
        return res
```
