## 题目：
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

Constraints:
```
m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n <= 105
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
```

## 答案：
```
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
     
        if len(s) < len(t):
            return ''
        
        #初始化新加入key的value为0
        hs, ht = collections.Counter(), collections.Counter()
        for char in t:
            ht[char] += 1
            
        res = ''
        start = 0
        cnt = 0 #当前窗口中满足ht的字符个数
        for end in range(len(s)):
            hs[s[end]] += 1
            if hs[s[end]] <= ht[s[end]]: #必须加入的元素
                cnt += 1 #遇到了一个新的字符先加进了hs，所以相等的情况cnt也+1
            while start <= end and hs[s[start]] > ht[s[start]]:#窗口内元素都符合，开始压缩窗口
                hs[s[start]] -= 1
                start += 1
            if cnt == len(t):
                if not res or end-start + 1 < len(res): #res为空或者遇到了更短的长度
                    res = s[start:end + 1]
        return res
        

```
