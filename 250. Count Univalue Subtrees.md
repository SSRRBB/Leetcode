https://leetcode.com/problems/count-univalue-subtrees/

Given the root of a binary tree, return the number of uni-value subtrees.

A uni-value subtree means all nodes of the subtree have the same value.

 

Example 1:
```

Input: root = [5,1,5,5,5,null,5]
Output: 4
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```
Example 3:
```
Input: root = [5,5,5,5,5,null,5]
Output: 6
```

Constraints:
```
The number of the node in the tree will be in the range [0, 1000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
```
## 思路：
DFS
```
Given a node in our tree, we know that it is a univalue subtree if it meets one of the following criteria:

The node has no children (base case)
All of the node's children are univalue subtrees, and the node and its children all have the same value
With this in mind we can perform a depth-first-search on our tree, and test if each subtree is uni-value in a bottom-up manner.

```

## 答案：
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def countUnivalSubtrees(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None: 
            return 0
        self.count = 0
        self.helper(root)
        return self.count
    
    def helper(self, node):
        # base case - if the node has no children this is a univalue subtree
        if node.left == None and node.right == None:
            self.count += 1
            return True
         # check if all of the node's children are univalue subtrees and if they have the same value
        res = True
        if node.left:
            res = self.helper(node.left) and node.val == node.left.val and res
        if node.right:
            res = self.helper(node.right) and node.val == node.right.val and res
         # increment self.res and return whether a univalue tree exists here
        if res:
            self.count += 1
        return res
        
```
