## 题目：https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-increasing-frequency/

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order.

Return the sorted array.
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2]
Explanation: '3' has a frequency of 1, '1' has a frequency of 2, and '2' has a frequency of 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,3,2]
Output: [1,3,3,2,2]
Explanation: '2' and '3' both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted in decreasing order.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]
Output: [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
```
## 思路：
sorted(hashmap.items(), key = lambda x:(x[1],-x[0])) ##先对value升序，在再对key降序
## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # [2,3,1,3,2] 》 [1,3,3,2,2]
        hashmap = collections.Counter(nums)
        hashmapsort = sorted(hashmap.items(), key = lambda x:(x[1],-x[0])) ##先对value升序，在再对key降序
        res = []
        for key, value in hashmapsort:
            for _ in range(value):
                res.append(key)
        return res
