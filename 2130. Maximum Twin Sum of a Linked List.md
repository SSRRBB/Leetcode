https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list/

In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.

For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.
The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.

```
Example 1:

Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. 

Example 2:

Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. 

Example 3:

Input: head = [1,100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.
 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is an even integer in the range [2, 105].
1 <= Node.val <= 105
```

## 答案：
**list + two pointer**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def pairSum(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:
        #先变成数组，再双指针
        p = head
        tmp = []
        while p:
            tmp.append(p.val)
            p = p.next
        
        res = float('-inf')
        i = 0
        j = len(tmp) - 1
        while i < j:
            res = max(res, tmp[i] + tmp[j])
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        return res
```
**快慢找中间876 + 反转**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def pairSum(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:
    ######## 快慢指针+反转
        res = 0
        # 快慢指针，找到链表的中间节点(876) [5,4,2,1]
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        
        fast, slow = dummy, dummy
        
        while fast.next and fast.next.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next #slow = 4, fast = 1
        slow = slow.next #slow = 2
        # (206)根据孪生节点的定义， 第 i 个节点与第 (n-1-i) 个节点 为孪生节点，需要反转第二部分的链表的节点
        pre = None
        cur = slow
        while cur:
            temp = cur.next # 先把原来cur.next位置存起来
            cur.next = pre # 接着把 cur.next 指向前驱节点 pre
            pre = cur # pre节点前移
            cur = temp # cur节点前移
        #变成【5，4】和【2，1】
        # 配对孪生节点找到孪生节点的最大和
        while pre:
            res = max(res, head.val + pre.val)
            pre, head = pre.next, head.next

        return res
```
