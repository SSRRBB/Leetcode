## 题目：263. Ugly Number

## 思路：

A **prime number质数** is a number greater than 1 with only two factors – themselves and 1.

**Composite numbers** are whole numbers that have two factors and are not prime numbers, as they can be divided by more than two numbers

**Prime factor质因数** is the factor of the given number which is a prime number. 

**Prime factorization质因数分解** is a way of expressing a number as a product of its prime factors

**Factors因数** are the numbers you multiply together to get another number

class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        
        for p in [2, 3, 5]:
            while n % p == 0:
                n = n // p
        return n == 1
        

```
