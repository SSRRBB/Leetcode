## 题目：1492. The kth Factor of n

https://leetcode.com/problems/the-kth-factor-of-n/

You are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.

Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.
```
Example 1:
Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.

Example 2:
Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 7], the 2nd factor is 7.

Example 3:
Input: n = 4, k = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4], there is only 3 factors. We should return -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= n <= 1000

Could you solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity?

## 答案：
**math 优化**
```python
class Solution:
    def kthFactor(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:    
        ## math 优化 O(sqrtn)
        count = 0
        # iterate from 1 to sqrt(n)
        for factor in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            if n % factor == 0:
                count += 1
                if count == k:
                    return factor
        # remove dupliate count
        if int(n ** 0.5) * int(n ** 0.5) == n:
            count -= 1
        # iterate from  sqrt(n) to 1, really factor is n /k
        for factor in range(int(n ** 0.5), 0, -1):
            if n % factor == 0:
                count += 1
                if count == k:
                    return n // factor
        return -1
````
**Brute force**
```python
#Brute force O(n)
class Solution:
    def kthFactor(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        ## Brute force O(n)
        count = 0
        for factor in range(1, n + 1): #【1， n】中找factor
            if n % factor == 0:
                count += 1
                if count == k:
                    return factor
        return -1
```

## 思路：
**Brute force O(n)**

**math 优化 O(sqrtn)**
