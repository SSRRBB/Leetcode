## 题目：
Given n pieces of wood with length L[i] (integer array). Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length. What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.

The unit of length is centimeter.The length of the woods are all positive integers,you couldn't cut wood into float length.If you couldn't get >= k pieces, return 0.
Example
```
Example 1
Input:
L = [232, 124, 456]
k = 7
Output: 114
Explanation: We can cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 114cm long, however we can't cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 115cm long.
```
Example 2
Input:
L = [1, 2, 3]
k = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: It is obvious we can't make it.
```
Challenge
O(n log Len), where Len is the longest length of the wood.
