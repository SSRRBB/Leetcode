## 题目：
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.


Example 1:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```
Example 3:
```
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```
Constraints:
```
1 <= numCourses <= 2000
0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
ai != bi
All the pairs [ai, bi] are distinct.

## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
      
        #1. 统计每个点的入度 和构建图  # Get the indegree and adjacency of every course.
        # 构建图，代表（先修课>后修课）的映射
        # graph[i]的i代表先修课,graph[i]代表后修课
        in_degree = [0] * numCourses
        graph = [[] for i in range(numCourses)]
        for nextcourse, precourse in prerequisites:
            graph[precourse].append(nextcourse)
            in_degree[nextcourse] += 1
        print(in_degree)
        print(graph)
        
        #2.将每个入度为0的点放入队列，# Get all the courses with the indegree of 0.
        queue = collections.deque()
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if in_degree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)

        # 记录已修课程的数量
        num_choose = 0
        # 记录拓扑顺序
        topo_order = []
        
        #3.不断从队列中拿出一个点，去掉这个点的所有连边（指向其他点的边）其他点的相应入度为 -1 # BFS TopSort.
        while queue:
            curcourse = queue.popleft()
            topo_order.append(curcourse)
            num_choose += 1
            # 4. 当前点的所有邻居入度减1，如果入度降为 0，再加入队列
            for neighbors in graph[curcourse]:
                in_degree[neighbors] -= 1
                if in_degree[neighbors] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbors)
        #如果全部课程已经被修过，那么返回拓扑排序，否则返回空
        if num_choose == numCourses:
            return topo_order
        return []

```
