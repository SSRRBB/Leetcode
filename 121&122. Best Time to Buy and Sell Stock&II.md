## 题目：121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
```
Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 
Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104
```
## 思路：

因为股票就买卖一次，那么贪心的想法很自然就是取最左最小值，取最右最大值，那么得到的差值就是最大利润。

## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # Brute force O(n^2)
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices) - 1):
            for j in range(i, len(prices)):
                profit = prices[j] - prices[i]
                if profit > max_profit:
                    max_profit = profit
        return max_profit
       
        ## Greedy O(n)
        minprice = float('inf')
        maxprofit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            minprice = min(minprice, prices[i]) #取最左最小价格
            maxprofit = max(maxprofit, prices[i] - minprice) #直接取最大区间利润
        return maxprofit

```
## 122 思路：
```
# 从图中可以发现，其实我们需要收集每天的正利润就可以，收集正利润的区间，就是股票买卖的区间
    #而我们只需要关注最终利润，不需要记录区间。
```

## 122 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            res += max(prices[i] - prices[i - 1], 0)
        return res

```

## 题目：122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/
ou are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104
0 <= prices[i] <= 104
```
