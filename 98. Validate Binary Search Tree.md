## 题目：
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1
```

## 思路：
BST iteration 中序遍历不下降，在leetcode里面没有相等的元素，

巧妙的加了pre

## 答案：
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        
        #中序遍历 迭代
        pre = None   # res = []
        stack = []
        cur = root 
        
        while cur or stack:
            while cur:
                stack.append(cur)
                cur = cur.left
            tmp = stack.pop()
            if pre and pre.val >= tmp.val:
                return False
            pre = tmp    # res.append(tmp)
            cur = tmp.right
        return True
        

```
