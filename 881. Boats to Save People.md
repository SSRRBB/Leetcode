## 题目：881. Boats to Save People

https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/

```
You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.

 

Example 1:

Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
Example 2:

Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
Example 3:

Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
 

Constraints:

1 <= people.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 104
```
## 思路：

## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        #排序
        people.sort()
        left = 0
        right = len(people) - 1
        
        res = 0
        while left <= right:
            res += 1 #无论如何，都有结果
            if people[left] + people[right] > limit: # 超重的直接pass，算作一个单独的结果。
                right -= 1
            else: #能配对上的，也是一组结果，就让两个指针各进一步。
                left += 1
                right -= 1
        return res

```
