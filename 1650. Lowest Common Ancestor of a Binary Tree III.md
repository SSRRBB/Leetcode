## 题目：
Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for Node is below:
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
```
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5 since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```
Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
-109 <= Node.val <= 109
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q exist in the tree.
```

## 答案：
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.parent = None
"""

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        #有self.parent指回去
        #把A的祖先放大哈希表里
        parent_set = set()
        curr = p
        while curr is not None:
            parent_set.add(curr)
            curr = curr.parent

        #遍历B的祖先接节点，第一个在哈希表中出现的就是答案
        curr = q
        while curr is not None:
            if curr in parent_set:
                return curr
            curr = curr.parent
        return None
        

```
