## 题目：
You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.



Example 1:
```
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
```
Example 3:
```
Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= fruits.length <= 105
0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length
```

## 思路：
同向双指针 + 哈希表
```
#创建一个空的哈希表(用counter计数器更方便；fruit种类：出现次数)，并设置左指针为0
#然后右指针遍历数组，将数组fruit种类：出现次数添加至哈希表中
#当哈希表的长度大于2时，先把fruit是start的种类次数减一，然后右移左指针，直到长度为2停止，在过程中删除哈希表中的对应内容。
#循环2、3，并持续计算满足要求后的最大长度即可

```


## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def totalFruit(self, fruits: List[int]) -> int:
        # step1:# 定义需要维护的变量
        # 创建一个空的哈希表(用counter计数器更方便；fruit种类：出现次数)
        res = 0
        counter = collections.Counter()
        # step 2  定义窗口的首尾端 (start, end)， 然后滑动窗口
        start = 0
        for end, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
            # Step 3: 更新需要维护的变量 
            counter[fruit] += 1
            if len(counter) <= 2:
                res = max(res, end - start + 1)
            # Step 4: 
            # 根据题意,  题目的窗口长度可变: 这个时候一般涉及到窗口是否合法的问题
            # 这时要用一个while去不断移动窗口左指针, 从而剔除非法元素直到窗口再次合法
            while len(counter) > 2:
                counter [fruits[start]] -= 1
                if counter [fruits[start]] == 0:
                    del counter [fruits[start]]
                start += 1
        
        return res

    



        

```
```python
class Solution:
    def totalFruit(self, fruits: List[int]) -> int:
        counter = collections.Counter()
        res, start = 0, 0
        for end, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
            counter[fruit] += 1
            while len(counter) > 2:
                counter [fruits[start]] -= 1
                if counter [fruits[start]] == 0:
                    del counter [fruits[start]]
                start += 1
            res = max(res, end - start + 1)
        return res



```
