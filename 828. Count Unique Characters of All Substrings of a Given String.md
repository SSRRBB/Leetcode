## 题目：
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-unique-characters-of-all-substrings-of-a-given-string/
Let's define a function countUniqueChars(s) that returns the number of unique characters on s.

For example, calling countUniqueChars(s) if s = "LEETCODE" then "L", "T", "C", "O", "D" are the unique characters since they appear only once in s, therefore countUniqueChars(s) = 5.
Given a string s, return the sum of countUniqueChars(t) where t is a substring of s.

Notice that some substrings can be repeated so in this case you have to count the repeated ones too.

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "ABC"
Output: 10
Explanation: All possible substrings are: "A","B","C","AB","BC" and "ABC".
Every substring is composed with only unique letters.
Sum of lengths of all substring is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10

Example 2:

Input: s = "ABA"
Output: 8
Explanation: The same as example 1, except countUniqueChars("ABA") = 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "LEETCODE"
Output: 92
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of uppercase English letters only.

## 思路：
```
   #先紀錄每次字符出現的位置
        #在算出每個字符生命週期
        #舉例來說ABAA
        #######
           #Think about string ABAA and focus on making the second "A" a unique character.
           #We can take A(BA)A  and between "()" is our substring.
           #We can see here, to make the second "A" counted as a uniq character, we need to:
           #insert "(" somewhere between the first and second A: A(BA or AB(A two possible
           #insert ")" somewhere between the second and third A: ABA)A
        #######    
           #第二個A的出現次數為
           #(2 - 0)* (3 - 2 ) ==> (目前index - 上次index)*(下次index - 目前index)
           #最左 最右邊另外處理
```
## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def uniqueLetterString(self, s: str) -> int:
        #先紀錄每次字符出現的位置
        #在算出每個字符生命週期
        #舉例來說ABAA
        #######
           #Think about string ABAA and focus on making the second "A" a unique character.
           #We can take A(BA)A  and between "()" is our substring.
           #We can see here, to make the second "A" counted as a uniq character, we need to:
           #insert "(" somewhere between the first and second A: A(BA or AB(A two possible
           #insert ")" somewhere between the second and third A: ABA)A
        #######    
           #第二個A的出現次數為
           #(2 - 0)* (3 - 2 ) ==> (目前index - 上次index)*(下次index - 目前index)
            #最左 最右邊另外處理
       
        ##时间和空间都为O(n)
        n = len(s)
        d = defaultdict(list)
        #先紀錄每次字符出現的位置
        for i, c in enumerate(s): #ABA
            d[c].append(i) #{A:[0,2];B:[1]}
            
        #在算出每個字符生命週期
        res = 0
        for c, index in d.items():
            l = -1
            center = index[0]
            for i in range(1,len(index)):
                r = index[i]
                res += (center-l)*(r-center)
                l = center
                center = r
            res += (center-l)*(n-center)
        return res
```
