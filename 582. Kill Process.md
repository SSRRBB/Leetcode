## 题目：

https://leetcode.com/problems/kill-process/

You have n processes forming a rooted tree structure. You are given two integer arrays pid and ppid, where pid[i] is the ID of the ith process and ppid[i] is the ID of the ith process's parent process.

Each process has only one parent process but may have multiple children processes. Only one process has ppid[i] = 0, which means this process has no parent process (the root of the tree).

When a process is killed, all of its children processes will also be killed.

Given an integer kill representing the ID of a process you want to kill, return a list of the IDs of the processes that will be killed. You may return the answer in any order.

```
Example 1:

Input: pid = [1,3,10,5], ppid = [3,0,5,3], kill = 5
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The processes colored in red are the processes that should be killed.
Example 2:

Input: pid = [1], ppid = [0], kill = 1
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

n == pid.length
n == ppid.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
1 <= pid[i] <= 5 * 104
0 <= ppid[i] <= 5 * 104
Only one process has no parent.
All the values of pid are unique.
kill is guaranteed to be in pid.
```
## 思路：
hashmap构建图

BFS删除

## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def killProcess(self, pid: List[int], ppid: List[int], kill: int) -> List[int]:
        #step1, 构建图mapping建立PPID(父) - > PID 映射关系
        mapping = collections. defaultdict(list)
  
        for i in range(len(ppid)):
            mapping[ppid[i]].append(pid[i])
        #print(mapping) #{3: [1, 5], 0: [3], 5: [10]})

        #step 2 BFS
        #search through the dictionary in BFS fashion to get all the processes that will be killed.
        res = []
        queue = collections.deque([kill])
        while queue:
            kill = queue.popleft()
            res.append(kill)
            if kill in mapping:
                #print(mapping[kill]) #[5,10]
                queue.extend(mapping[kill]) ##不能是append了

        return res
```
