## 题目：
You are given an integer array nums of length n where nums is a permutation of the integers in the range [1, n]. You are also given a 2D integer array sequences where sequences[i] is a subsequence of nums.

Check if nums is the shortest possible and the only supersequence. The shortest supersequence is a sequence with the shortest length and has all sequences[i] as subsequences. There could be multiple valid supersequences for the given array sequences.

For example, for sequences = [[1,2],[1,3]], there are two shortest supersequences, [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
While for sequences = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,2,3]], the only shortest supersequence possible is [1,2,3]. [1,2,3,4] is a possible supersequence but not the shortest.
Return true if nums is the only shortest supersequence for sequences, or false otherwise.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], sequences = [[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are two possible supersequences: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
The sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of both: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
The sequence [1,3] is a subsequence of both: [1,2,3] and [1,3,2].
Since nums is not the only shortest supersequence, we return false.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], sequences = [[1,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: The shortest possible supersequence is [1,2].
The sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of it: [1,2].
Since nums is not the shortest supersequence, we return false.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], sequences = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: true
Explanation: The shortest possible supersequence is [1,2,3].
The sequence [1,2] is a subsequence of it: [1,2,3].
The sequence [1,3] is a subsequence of it: [1,2,3].
The sequence [2,3] is a subsequence of it: [1,2,3].
Since nums is the only shortest supersequence, we return true.
```

Constraints:
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
nums is a permutation of all the integers in the range [1, n].
1 <= sequences.length <= 104
1 <= sequences[i].length <= 104
1 <= sum(sequences[i].length) <= 105
1 <= sequences[i][j] <= n
All the arrays of sequences are unique.
sequences[i] is a subsequence of nums.
```

**要保证 queue 里最多同时只有一个元素即可。才能 only**

**zip()**

```python
a = [1,2,3]
b = [4,5,6]
c = [4,5,6,7,8]
zipped1 = zip(a,b) # 返回一个对象
zipped2 = zip(a,c) 
print(list(zipped1))  # list() 转换为列表
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
print(list(zipped2))  # 元素个数与最短的列表一
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
```

## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def sequenceReconstruction(self, nums: List[int], sequences: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        ##O(SL) worst time, s is numbers pf sequences, L is max lenght of seq
        ##O(N) space, n = len(nums)
        in_degree = [0] * (len(nums) + 1) #这里 nums from 1 to n,实际上in_degree[0]已经灭有意义了
        graph = [[] for _ in range((len(nums) + 1))]
        for seq in sequences:  ##这里不一样
            for prenode, nextnode in zip(seq, seq[1:]):
                graph[prenode].append(nextnode)
                in_degree[nextnode] += 1
        print(in_degree)
        print(graph)
           
        #O(N^2) worst time O(N) space
        queue = collections.deque()
        for i in range(1, len(nums) + 1): #从一开始，是因为我们nums灭有0，in_degree[0] == 0也没有意义
            if in_degree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)
        
        topo_order = []
        while queue:
            if len(queue) != 1: #这说明我们可能有很多路径，不是only的
                return False
            curnode = queue.popleft()
            topo_order.append(curnode)
            for neighbors in graph[curnode]:
                in_degree[neighbors] -= 1
                if in_degree[neighbors] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbors)
        return topo_order == nums
         
```
