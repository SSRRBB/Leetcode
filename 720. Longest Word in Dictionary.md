## 题目：720. Longest Word in Dictionary
Given an array of strings words representing an English Dictionary, return the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other words in words.

If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty string.

```
Example 1:

Input: words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
Example 2:

Input: words = ["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation: Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length <= 30
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
```
## 思路：
hahsmap

trie(怎么搞？)

## 答案：
```Python
class Solution:
    def longestWord(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        #排序，
        #遍历words:判断每个单词去掉倒数第一个字母是否在set里面
        
        words.sort()
        seen = set()
        longestword = ''
        for word in words:
            if len(word) == 1 or word[:-1] in seen: ##如果长度唯一时，去掉最后一个是字符串为空，我们set()里面没有设置字符串为空的一项
                seen.add(word)
                if len(word) > len(longestword):
                    longestword = word
        return longestword
    
    
       ###set() == set('')
     ###set(['']) == {''}
        words.sort()
        seen = set(['']) ##set()里面有设置字符串为空的
        longestword = ''
        for word in words:
            if word[:-1] in seen:
                seen.add(word)
                if len(word) > len(longestword):
                    longestword = word
        return longestword
```
