## 题目：
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.


Example 1:
```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
``` 

Constraints:
```
1 <= n <= 231 - 1
```

## 思路：
**检查数字是否在哈希集合中需要 O(1)的时间，而对于其他数据结构，则需要 O(n)的时间。选择正确的数据结构是解决这些问题的关键部分。**
**时间和空间都为O(logn)

## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:

        seen = set()
        while n != 1 and n not in seen:
            seen.add(n)
            n = self.get_next(n)

        return n == 1
    
    def get_next(self, n):
        total_sum = 0
        while n > 0:
            total_sum += (n % 10) ** 2
            n = n // 10
        return total_sum

```

## 题目：263. Ugly Number

## 思路：

A **prime number质数** is a number greater than 1 with only two factors – themselves and 1.

**Prime factor质因数** is the factor of the given number which is a prime number. 

**Prime factorization质因数分解** is a way of expressing a number as a product of its prime factors

**Factors因数** are the numbers you multiply together to get another number

## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        
        for p in [2, 3, 5]:
            while n % p == 0:
                n = n // p
        return n == 1
        

```
