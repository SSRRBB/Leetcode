## 题目：1996. The Number of Weak Characters in the Game
https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-weak-characters-in-the-game/

You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has two main properties: attack and defense. You are given a 2D integer array properties where properties[i] = [attacki, defensei] represents the properties of the ith character in the game.

A character is said to be weak if any other character has both attack and defense levels strictly greater than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character i is said to be weak if there exists another character j where attackj > attacki and defensej > defensei.

Return the number of weak characters.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: properties = [[5,5],[6,3],[3,6]]
Output: 0
Explanation: No character has strictly greater attack and defense than the other.
Example 2:

Input: properties = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The first character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
Example 3:

Input: properties = [[1,5],[10,4],[4,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The third character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
 

Constraints:

2 <= properties.length <= 105
properties[i].length == 2
1 <= attacki, defensei <= 105
```

## 答案：
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfWeakCharacters(self, properties: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ## 按照攻击降序(从大到小)、攻击相同时防御升序(从小到大)排列
        properties = sorted(properties, key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))
        # 从前向后遍历，记录当前最大防御
        max_defense = 0
        count = 0
        for p in properties:
            #因为p[i]前面的角色的攻击值均大于等于p[i], 且p[i]前面的跟p[i]攻击值相同的角色防御值小于p[i]
            #所以如果当前访问的角色p[i]的防御值小于当前的最大防御值，那么p[i]为弱角色。
            if p[1] >= max_defense: 
                max_defense = p[1]
            else:
                count += 1
        return count
```

## 思路：
排序 + greedy
